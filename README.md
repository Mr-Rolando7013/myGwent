# myGwent

This is a python recreation of the Gwent minigame in The Witcher 3 owned by CD Project Red.

The witcher are my favorite games and books of all the time. And what I love the most, are their complex characters that would always get into difficult decisions to take. In my opinion, that's how this story makes us feel so identified.

It is important to state that this game still lacks a lot of stuff. For example the weather and leader cards. It also lacks the “special powers” that certain cards have. The file paths are also hardcoded. One possible solution to this, is hosting the files in a blob storage, but that’s a future implementation. For now, I want to continue with other projects.
